This code was written for a private project. My goal was to create my own kitchen inventory system. All you need is a Raspberry Pi and a Barcode Scanner.
Further documentation can be obtained on my website. Understand that, although web scraping of public data is not illegal, I had to redact the adress of the service I am using, but I'm confident you will find a suitable replacement.
As long as you keep the number of requests to a minimum and only use the scraped data for private purposes, you should be well inside the bounds of legality.
Depending on the layout of the site you are using, you might need to adjust the query. Also, the DOM layout will probably be much different.

The Adafruit LCD Display is optional. If you aren't using it, just remove all code related to it.
